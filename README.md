## Executive Summary

The tech industry moves fast, and staying relevant means knowing which skills are gaining traction and where opportunities are concentrated. This project combines job posting data (via API), salary tables (via web scraping), and survey results to identify which programming languages and technologies are most in demand, how salaries compare, and where the top markets are located. By integrating multiple data sources, the analysis highlights actionable insights for recruiters, job seekers, and educators. In a real-world setting, these insights could **cut** recruiter **time-to-hire by 20%** and help professionals **boost salaries by $10Kâ€“$15K** by focusing on high-value skills.Potential next steps include building an automated pipeline to track job market shifts in real time.

## Business Problem

Recruiters struggle to match talent with rapidly shifting technology needs, while professionals risk investing time in skills that may not pay off. Companies also want to benchmark salaries to remain competitive. The challenge: sift through fragmented data sources (job boards, surveys, salary tables) and distill a clear view of in-demand skills, high-paying languages, and geographic hot spots. This project addresses that gap by merging structured and unstructured data into a coherent, decision-ready analysis.

## Methodology  

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Extracted job postings and skills from JSON API.
   - Scraped salary data from public HTML tables.
   - Processed survey CSVs covering demographics and tech adoption.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Normalized survey responses using pandas.
   - Cleaned and structured salary data with BeautifulSoup.
   - Engineered features for programming language demand and salary mapping.

3. **Analysis & Visualization:**
   - Python (matplotlib) for job/salary breakdowns.
   - Power BI dashboards to compare current vs. future tech usage.
   - Presentation slides for stakeholder-ready insights.

## Results and Business Recommendation  

- **Most In-Demand Skills:** Python, SQL, and TypeScript dominated job postings.
- **High-Value Skills:** Swift and Python commanded average salaries above **$120K**.
- **Market Hotspots:** Washington DC and Detroit emerged as leading tech job hubs.
- **Survey Insights:** Highlighted gaps between current vs. future tech adoption, useful for planning workforce training.

**Recommendation:** Recruiters should double down on sourcing Python and SQL talent while expanding pipelines in cities with growing demand. Training providers should focus on future-oriented skills like Swift and TypeScript to stay ahead of demand.

## Next Steps  

If expanded, this project could:
- Automate job market tracking via scheduled API/web scraping pipelines.
- Add LinkedIn/Indeed datasets for broader coverage.
- Model demand-supply gaps to forecast salary growth.
- Track how demand for emerging skills (AI/ML tools, cloud platforms) evolves quarterly.
- Address data limitations such as inconsistent salary reporting and incomplete job postings.
